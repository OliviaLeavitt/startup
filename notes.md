# Notes

## GitHub

### Cloning a Repository
- **Clone a Repository:**
  - When you clone a repository it is placed in a subdirectory named with the name of the repository. So make sure you are in the directory where you keep all of your source repositories before you run the command.
  - Use `git clone <repository-url>` to clone a repository.

### Making Changes
- **Make Changes:**
  **This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process.**
  1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub `git pull <file>`
  2. change files and use `git add <file>` to stage changes.
  3. Commit changes with `git commit -m "commit message"`.
  - Push changes using `git push`.
- **Pull Updates:**
  - Fetch updates with `git fetch`.
  - Use `git pull` to get the latest changes from the repository and add them to a local enviroment (vscode)

### Handling Merge Conflicts
  1. Open the problem file and resolve the conflicts by editing the problem line/lines.
  2. Mark the file as resolved by adding it to the staging area with git add <filename>.
  3. Commit the resolution with a message explaining the merge.
  4. Push the merged changes back to GitHub with git push.

## AWS EC2 Instance Setup

### Steps

1. **Create AWS EC2 Instance**
   - Start a new EC2 instance using the following AMI ID: ami-0b009f6c56cdd83ed
   - Selected instance type: `t3.micro` (or `t2.micro` if free).
   - Set up security to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS access.
   - Create a key pair and save it to a safe location for future logins.

2. **Assign Elastic IP**
   - Get an elastic IP to keep the same public IP address
   - Attach the elastic IP to the instance

3. **Testing the Web Server**
   - Open a browser and enter http://<public-ip>.
   - Check to see that the page loads correctly.

4. **SSH into your server**
   - Open a console and enter: 
     ```bash
     ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[public_ip]
     ```


## Amazon Web Services - Route 53 Notes
### Steps to Buy a Domain
1. Log in to AWS Console > Route 53.
2. Navigate to **Domains > Registered domains** > **Register Domain**.
3. Search for a domain, select one, and **Add to cart**.
4. Fill out contact details and complete the order.
5. AWS will create a **hosted zone** for your domain.

### Create DNS Records
1. Get the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
2. Log in to AWS Console > Route 53 > **Hosted zones**.
3. Create an **A Record** for your root domain (use your server's IP address).
4. Create another **A Record** (`*`) for any subdomain (use your server's IP).

### Test DNS
- Navigate to your domain name in the browser (example: `http://yourdomain.com`).

### Common Issues
- **Domain not accessible:** Wait 10 minutes for DNS records to propagate.
- **Site doesn't display:** Check if you're using HTTPS, or if the browser added `www.`.
- **Email verification:** Ensure you responded to AWS verification email (check spam).

## HTML Structure Elements Tutorial

### Overview

The two major purposes of HTML are to provide **structure** and **content** to your web application. Some of the common HTML structural elements include:
- `body`
- `header`
- `footer`
- `main`
- `section`
- `aside`
- `p`
- `table`
- `ol` / `ul`
- `div`
- `span`

We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top-level content `body`. The `body` has three children: a `header`, `main`, and `footer`. Each of these elements contains other structural content.

- **Header** contains a paragraph with a `span`, and a `nav` containing multiple `div` elements.
- **Main** contains multiple `section` elements, which include an unordered list (`ul`) and a table. `Main` also contains an `aside` for content that doesn’t fit the main content flow.
- **Footer** has a `div` with a single `span`.

### Example HTML Structure

```html
<body>
  <p>Body</p>
  <header>
    <p>Header - <span>Span</span></p>
    <nav>
      Navigation
      <div>Div</div>
      <div>Div</div>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <aside>
      <p>Aside</p>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div>Footer - <span>Span</span></div>
  </footer>
</body>
